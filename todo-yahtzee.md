OLD, original version. See more up to date version (connected to github) in www folder.

## Maybe later

- Translate to EN
- Design update (more modern, add pure js/css animations)
- Make responsive.
- make event listeners separate?
- use message class to display Game over or error in page itself
- review class instances for scores: default scores (1-6 instances), and specific scores (classes) which extend class, with method containing test (if faces match criteria) and property for resulting number (or only the result: 0 or a number).
- Make multi-player?
